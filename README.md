**Question 1:**

a) Run the code q1_a.m which uses 'fourierCoeff.m' function and generates a graph of Fourier coefficients for given xt.The graphs are stored in 'Result' folder, 'q1_a.png' and analytical verification in 'Report.pdf'

b) Run the q1_b.m code which uses 'fourierCoeff.m' function and generates a graph of Fourier coefficients for given xt. the graphs are stored in 'Result' folder, 'q1_a.png' and analytical verification in 'Report.pdf' 

**Question 2:**

a&b) Run q3_a_b.m code which uses 'fourierCoeff.m' and 'partialfouriersum.m' function for reconstructiong the input signal from fourier coefficients 

c) Run 'q3_c.m' code to get MAE and RMS Error. The analysis is written in 'Report.pdf'

**Question 3:**

a) Written in 'Report.pdf' 

b) Run the code 'q3_b.m to get Fourier Series Coefficients for square signal with different values of T and respective result is in 'Result' folder, 'q3_b.png'. Analysis is written in 'Report.pdf' 

c) Run the code 'q3_c.m to reconstruct the original square signal with differnt values of N and it calls 'fourierCoeff.m' function and 'partialfouriersum.m' function, the respective result is in 'Result' folder, 'q3_c.png'. Analysis is written in 'Report.pdf'

**Question 4:**

a) Run the code 'q4_a.m to get Fourier coefficients for given x1(t) and it calls 'fourierCoeff.m' function, the respective result is in 'Result' folder, 'q4_a.png' 

b) Run the code 'q4_b.m to get Fourier coefficients for given x2(t) and it calls 'fourierCoeff.m' function, the respective result is in 'Result' folder, 'q4_b.png' 

c) Written in 'Report.pdf'
